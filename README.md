The Magic 8-Ball is a game that provides cryptic and funny answers to the questions you ask. The ball is round in shape and black in color. It has been named as such because it resembles the ball used in billiards.

Magic 8-Ball contains a multi-sided dice suspended in alcohol. Each face of the dice has a printed response which gets pressed against the window whenever you shake it. To use the ball, you just ask a question and give it a good shake. From there, it displays the answer through a clear window on its side.
